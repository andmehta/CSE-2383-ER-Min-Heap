# CSE-2383-ER-Min-Heap
Using heaps and priority queuing, design and implement an emergency room simulator. The purpose of the simulator is to model the daily flow of patients through an emergency room. The system must be able to store the patient's name and complaint and then be able to prioritize their access based on the severity of their complaint and the order they entered the ER.
